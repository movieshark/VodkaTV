msgid "The completion of the add-on was made possible by the generous people who offered their accounts (tompi and vargalex - thanks!) and weeks of research work. Therefore, please [B]read the following carefully[/B]! If something is unclear, this text can be accessed at any time from the 'About' section in the add-on's main menu. Also, feel free to ask questions on the forum. ;)\n"
"\n"
"1. By logging into the add-on, you automatically accept the Terms and Conditions of the underlying platform and agree to abide by them. This add-on was created independently of the mentioned platform for the purpose of studying it. I do not recommend its use to anyone, and I am not taking any responsibility for any potential damage!\n"
"2. The add-on works only on a certain subset of devices such as Windows with the latest ChromeCDM, Android or Android TV with L1 certificates and certain Android TVs that support PlayReady with an SL3000 certificate. In case of Widevine  it requires the latest Widevine CDM and in both Widevine and Playready's case the  inputstream.adaptive add-on to function properly at the time of release. The add-on will make every effort to verify and install these components if necessary. However, resolving any resulting errors (such as playback not starting) is the user's responsibility.\n"
"3. [B]The add-on is in its early alpha stage. Currently the login flow and the live channel listing & playback is implemented.[/B] It's only purpose was studying the platform. Many of the code comes from the notyet add-on. By using this you may get banned temporarily or permanently. Again, I am not responsible. Rate limits are unknown as of now.\n"
"4. The add-on relies on the goodwill of the user. Therefore, it may not necessarily provide feedback in case of intentionally providing incorrect data if something goes wrong. The reasons for this are twofold: firstly, it is not possible to prepare for all possibilities as the platform is closed; secondly, handling these cases would significantly slow down the user experience. I kindly ask everyone to provide meaningful data.\n"
"5. The advanced settings of the add-on do not need to be modified by default, and it is not recommended to do so. Please only make changes if you have a good reason and are confident in the correctness of the modification, or if recommended by the developer. A good example of this is when a new version appears in the application but no add-on update is available with the new version number. In such cases, you can override it.\n"
"6. Most of the add-on's settings take effect after restarting Kodi or disabling and re-enabling the add-on. I recommend doing this after every change. The only exception is the 'device name' setting, which takes effect only after deleting the device identifier and re-logging.\n"
"7. The add-on supports both Hungarian and English languages. If Kodi starts in English, the add-on will also be in English. I welcome translations into other languages (if you see the need).\n"
"8. The add-on is not prepared for the scenario where you are logged out of the platform or another registered device on the platform logs you out due to reasons beyond your control. In such cases, it may encounter errors. Please make sure that your subscription is active, the official applications are working, and you have not exceeded the allowed device limit before reporting an error. It is recommended to delete cached login data, and if that doesn't solve the issue, reinstall the add-on, which attempts to log in again and re-register the device.\n"
